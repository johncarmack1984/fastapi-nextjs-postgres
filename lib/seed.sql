Based on the information you''ve provided, you''re experiencing several symptoms that could indicate a serious condition. Given your history of pulmonary embolisms and deep vein thrombosis, your current symptoms of chest pain, difficulty breathing, and vomiting could potentially indicate another pulmonary embolism. This is a condition where one or more arteries in your lungs become blocked by a blood clot. This is a serious condition that can damage your lungs and other organs in your body due to reduced oxygen flow.

### What you can do

Given the severity of your symptoms and your medical history, it''s important to seek immediate medical attention. Please go to the nearest emergency room or call an ambulance. Do not attempt to drive yourself.

### What you should look out for

If your symptoms worsen or if you experience any of the following, it''s crucial to seek immediate medical attention:

- Increased difficulty breathing
- Severe chest pain
- Coughing up blood
- A sudden onset of sharp, severe pain in your leg
- Swelling, redness, or warmth in your leg

Based on the information you''ve provided, possible diagnoses include:

- Lymphoma: This is a type of cancer that starts in the cells that are part of the body''s immune system. The symptoms you''ve described, including enlarged lymph nodes, weight loss, night sweats, and fatigue, are common symptoms of lymphoma.
  - Treatment typically involves chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of the two. The exact treatment plan will depend on the type and stage of the lymphoma.

- Infectious Mononucleosis: This is a viral infection caused by the Epstein-Barr virus. It can cause symptoms such as fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, and night sweats. However, it is less likely given the duration of your symptoms.
  - Treatment usually involves rest, hydration, and over-the-counter remedies for pain and fever.

- Autoimmune conditions: Given your family history, it''s also possible that an autoimmune condition could be causing your symptoms. Autoimmune conditions occur when your immune system mistakenly attacks your own body. Conditions such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis could potentially cause the symptoms you''re experiencing.
  - Treatment typically involves medications to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system.

### What you can do

Given the severity and duration of your symptoms, it''s important that you seek medical attention as soon as possible. Please make an appointment with your primary care provider or visit an urgent care clinic. They may refer you to a specialist, such as a hematologist or rheumatologist, for further evaluation and treatment.

### What you should look out for

Please seek immediate medical attention if you experience any of the following:

- Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath that is getting worse
- Severe headache or migraine that is not relieved by over-the-counter pain medication
- Fever or chills
- Any new or worsening symptoms

The patient has a history of a concussion 4 years ago, which has since been associated with balance issues, rating the severity as 5 out of 10. There is no mention of chest pain, severe shortness of breath, or specific triggers for the balance problems.', '### What might be happening

Based on the information you''ve provided, some possible diagnoses include:

- Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: This condition is characterized by extreme fatigue that can''t be explained by any underlying medical condition. The fatigue worsens with physical or mental activity, but doesn''t improve with rest. The cause of chronic fatigue syndrome is unknown, although there are many theories — ranging from viral infections to psychological stress.
  - Treatment typically focuses on symptom relief. This can include Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), graded exercise therapy (GET), and medication to control pain, nausea, and sleeping problems.

- Anemia: This is a condition that develops when your blood lacks enough healthy red blood cells or hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a main part of red blood cells and binds oxygen. If you have too few or abnormal red blood cells, or your hemoglobin is abnormal or low, the cells in your body will not get enough oxygen. Symptoms of anemia — like fatigue — occur because organs aren''t getting what they need to function properly.
  - Treatment depends on the cause of the anemia, but may include iron supplements, changes in diet, and in some cases, surgery.

- Hypothyroidism: This is a condition in which your thyroid gland doesn''t produce enough of certain crucial hormones. Hypothyroidism may not cause noticeable symptoms in the early stages. Over time, untreated hypothyroidism can cause a number of health problems, such as obesity, joint pain, infertility and heart disease.
  - Standard treatment for hypothyroidism involves daily use of the synthetic thyroid hormone levothyroxine.

- Depression: Depression is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest. It affects how you feel, think and behave and can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems. You may have trouble doing normal day-to-day activities, and sometimes you may feel as if life isn''t worth living.
  - Treatment usually involves a combination of medication and psychotherapy.

### What you can do

You should definitely consult with a healthcare provider to get a proper diagnosis. In the meantime, here are some general tips that might help:

1. Try to maintain a regular sleep schedule. Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends.
2. Eat a healthy diet. Make sure you''re getting all the nutrients your body needs. Include plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains in your diet.
3. Exercise regularly. Physical activity increases blood flow to your whole body, including your brain. Studies suggest regular exercise can improve mood and energy levels.
4. Limit alcohol and avoid drugs. These can both cause or worsen fatigue and interfere with sleep.
5. Stay hydrated. Dehydration can worsen feelings of fatigue.

### What you should look out for

Seek immediate medical help if you:

- Feel depressed
- Have suicidal thoughts
- Have trouble breathing
- Experience severe abdominal, chest or back pain
- Have a high fever
- Experience sudden weight loss

Remember, it''s important to consult with a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and treatment.', '');

The patient''s symptoms and history suggest a need for further medical evaluation to rule out conditions such as thrombosis, especially considering the sedentary nature of her job and cardiovascular symptoms.', '### What might be happening

Based on the information you have provided, possible explanations for your symptoms include:

- Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): This condition occurs when a blood clot forms in one or more of the deep veins in your body, usually in your legs. DVT can cause leg pain or swelling, but also can occur with no symptoms. DVT can be serious because blood clots in your veins can break loose, travel through your bloodstream and lodge in your lungs, blocking blood flow (pulmonary embolism). The fact that you have been sitting for long periods of time at work can increase your risk of DVT.
  - Treatment of DVT typically involves medications to thin your blood and slow its ability to clot. Sometimes filters are placed in the body''s main vein to prevent clots from being carried into the lungs.

- Cellulitis: This is a common bacterial skin infection that can cause redness, swelling, and pain in the affected area. The red, painful spots on your legs, feet, arms, and wrists could be a sign of this condition.
  - Treatment of cellulitis usually involves antibiotics to fight the infection.

- Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): This is a chronic condition in which the heart doesn''t pump blood as well as it should. Swelling in the feet and ankles is a common symptom of CHF, as are shortness of breath and chest pain. However, CHF is less likely given your age and lack of known heart disease.
  - Treatment of CHF typically involves a combination of lifestyle changes, medication, and sometimes surgery or devices.

### What you can do

You should seek immediate medical attention given your symptoms of swelling, red painful spots, shortness of breath, and chest pain. These could indicate serious conditions such as DVT or CHF. In the meantime:

1. Try to elevate your legs when you can to help reduce the swelling.
2. Avoid sitting for long periods of time. Try to take short walks or stretch every hour.
3. Drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated.

### What you should look out for

Reasons to seek immediate medical attention:

- If your shortness of breath or chest pain worsens
- If you develop a high fever (temperature over 100.4°F)
- If your swelling or red spots worsen or spread

These symptoms include a constant runny nose predominantly on the left side, sneezing, sore throat, generalized fatigue, and soreness in the legs, persisting for 5 days. The patient has not identified any specific aggravating or alleviating factors for the runny nose and has not observed any particular patterns or characteristics of the nasal discharge. No interventions have been noted to provide relief. There is no mention of fever or other systemic symptoms. The patient''s primary concerns are the runny nose and sore throat.', '### What might be happening

Based on the information you have provided, the most likely diagnoses include:

- Common Cold: This is a viral infection of your nose and throat (upper respiratory tract). It''s usually harmless, although it might not feel that way. Many types of viruses can cause a common cold. Symptoms might include a runny or stuffy nose, sneezing, cough, sore throat, and general fatigue.
  - Treatment for the common cold primarily involves relieving your symptoms, such as taking over-the-counter (OTC) cold remedies, staying hydrated, and resting.

- Influenza (Flu): This is a more severe viral infection that can cause symptoms similar to the common cold, but also includes body aches and fever. Given that you have not reported a fever, this is less likely but still possible.
  - Treatment for the flu can involve antiviral medications if started early in the course of the illness. Rest and hydration are also important.

- Allergies: Allergic rhinitis, or hay fever, can cause sneezing, runny or stuffy nose, and sore throat, especially if you''ve been exposed to an allergen such as dust, pollen, or pet dander.
  - Treatment for allergies can include avoiding known allergens and taking OTC allergy medications.

### What you can do

1. Rest and stay hydrated. Your body needs energy to fight off the virus. Getting enough sleep can boost your immune system and help you fight off the illness.
2. Over-the-counter cold remedies can help with symptoms of both the common cold and flu.
3. If you suspect allergies, try to identify and avoid the allergen. Over-the-counter antihistamines can help with symptoms.

### What you should look out for

If your symptoms worsen or you develop new symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, chest pain or pressure, confusion, or severe vomiting, seek medical attention immediately. These could be signs of a more serious condition.

Remember, this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific causes may not apply to your situation. Always consult with a healthcare provider for appropriate examination, testing, and care recommendations.', '');

Based on the information you''ve provided, here are a few possibilities:

- Musculoskeletal Strain: This is a common cause of muscle pain and can occur in the buttocks. It can be caused by overuse, improper use, or trauma. This would typically cause pain in the specific muscles that were strained, and the pain would likely be worsened by movement or pressure on those muscles. Treatment usually involves rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE), as well as over-the-counter pain relievers.

- Sciatica: This is a condition where the sciatic nerve, which runs from your lower back down each leg, becomes irritated or compressed. This can cause pain in the lower back and buttocks, and sometimes down the legs. However, you mentioned that your pain does not radiate down your legs, which makes this less likely. Treatment usually involves physical therapy and pain management.

- Chest pain and difficulty breathing: These are concerning symptoms that could indicate a number of serious conditions, including heart disease or lung conditions. Given your history of high blood pressure, it''s important to take these symptoms seriously.

### What you can do

Given the severity and duration of your symptoms, as well as the chest pain and difficulty breathing, I strongly recommend that you seek medical attention as soon as possible. In the meantime, try to rest and avoid any activities that worsen your pain. Over-the-counter pain relievers may help, but it''s important to talk to a healthcare professional before starting any new medication.

Based on your symptoms, here are a few possible conditions:

- Fibromyalgia: This is a disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue, sleep, memory and mood issues. It is often considered when there are multiple sites of pain and associated fatigue. However, this is usually a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning other potential causes need to be ruled out first.
  - Treatment typically involves a combination of medications, exercise, stress-reduction measures, and cognitive behavioral therapy.

- Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS): This condition causes severe fatigue that lasts for at least six months and is not improved by rest. Other symptoms can include headaches, joint pain, and difficulties with memory and concentration. However, like fibromyalgia, CFS is usually a diagnosis of exclusion.
  - Treatment typically involves a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy, graded exercise therapy, and medication to manage symptoms.

- Rheumatoid Arthritis: This is an autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the joints but can also cause systemic symptoms like fatigue and muscle pain. Given your family history of arthritis and your joint pain and swelling, this could be a possibility.
  - Treatment typically involves medications to slow the disease progression and manage symptoms, physical therapy, and in some cases surgery.

- Hypothyroidism: This is a condition where the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone. It can cause fatigue, joint and muscle pain, and cold sensitivity among other symptoms. However, it would not typically cause lightheadedness.
  - Treatment typically involves daily hormone replacement.

- Multiple Sclerosis: This is a disease of the central nervous system that can cause a wide variety of symptoms, including fatigue, dizziness, muscle and joint pain, and visual disturbances. However, it would be unusual to have MS without any neurological symptoms like numbness, tingling, or weakness.
  - Treatment typically involves medications to slow the disease progression and manage symptoms, physical therapy, and lifestyle modifications.

Please note that this list is not exhaustive and these conditions can present differently in different people. It''s also possible that there may be more than one thing contributing to your symptoms.

### What you can do

Given the complexity and duration of your symptoms, it''s important to seek medical attention. Here are some steps you can take:

1. Schedule an appointment with your primary care doctor. They can perform a physical examination and order tests to help determine what''s causing your symptoms.
2. Keep a symptom diary. Note when your symptoms occur, how long they last, and any potential triggers. This can help your doctor identify patterns and make a diagnosis.
3. Stay hydrated and eat a balanced diet. This can help manage your symptoms and improve your overall health.
4. Try to get regular exercise, as this can help with fatigue and joint pain. However, it''s important to start slow and gradually increase your activity level to avoid exacerbating your symptoms.

The patient had a clear CT scan in December 2022 and has no known drug allergies or chronic illnesses.', '### What might be happening

Based on the information you''ve provided, possible causes for your left lower abdominal pain include:

- **Functional gastrointestinal disorders**: These are conditions that cause problems with the function of your gastrointestinal tract. They can cause abdominal pain and other symptoms. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one example of a functional gastrointestinal disorder. It''s characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort and altered bowel habits. However, you haven''t mentioned any changes in your bowel habits, so this may not be the cause.
  - Treatment for functional gastrointestinal disorders often includes lifestyle changes, such as dietary modifications, and sometimes medications.

- **Gynecologic issues**: Given your sex and age, gynecologic issues could potentially cause left lower abdominal pain. You mentioned having had ovarian cysts in the past. Sometimes, these cysts can cause pain if they rupture or twist. Endometriosis is another condition that can cause chronic lower abdominal pain, but you''ve recently had a camera check for this.
  - Treatment for gynecologic issues depends on the specific condition and its severity. It may include hormonal treatments, pain relievers, and sometimes surgery.

- **Musculoskeletal pain**: Sometimes, pain in the abdomen can actually come from the muscles or other structures in the abdominal wall. This could potentially be the case, especially since you mentioned having a lipoma (a benign fatty tumor) in the area.
  - Treatment for musculoskeletal pain often involves physical therapy, pain relievers, and sometimes surgery.

### What you can do

It''s important to continue monitoring your symptoms. If the pain becomes severe, changes in character, or is associated with other symptoms like vomiting, fever, or significant changes in your bowel habits, you should seek medical attention immediately.

In the meantime, you can try the following:

1. Maintain a balanced diet: Avoid foods that seem to trigger your symptoms.
2. Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of fluids, especially water.
3. Try over-the-counter pain relievers: Non-prescription medications like acetaminophen (Tylenol) can help relieve minor pain. However, they should be used sparingly and always according to package instructions.

The patient experiences sudden onset of right-sided numbness that feels like a ''shot of novacaine'' with a sharp border, lasting about an hour. Additionally, there is occasional bowel incontinence without sensation, blurry vision, double vision, and a burning sensation in the right nostril concurrent with the numbness. The patient also reports stuttering, ''zoning out,'' and dizziness, which has been worsening over the past three years, particularly when standing up and walking. The patient has a significant medical history including coronary artery disease (CAD), white matter disease, a 9 mm lesion in the left posterior frontal lobe, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, arthritis, psoriasis, and eosinophilic esophagitis. The white matter disease and brain lesion were diagnosed a week ago, while the other conditions have been managed for the past 10 years. The patient has had a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and reports a family history of tachycardia, bypass surgery, and pacemaker implantation. No known drug allergies or substance use is reported. Current medications include metoprolol, lisinopril, atorvastatin, levothyroxine, omeprazole, and metformin.', '### What might be happening

Based on the information you''ve provided, here are a few possibilities:

- Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or Stroke: Your symptoms of sudden onset right-sided numbness, dizziness, and changes in speech could be signs of a TIA or stroke, especially given your history of coronary artery disease and other risk factors. A TIA is often called a "mini-stroke" and is a temporary blockage of blood flow to the brain. It can serve as a warning for a future stroke. A stroke is a more serious condition where the blood supply to a part of the brain is cut off, which can cause permanent damage.
  - Treatment usually involves medications to prevent blood clots and, in some cases, surgery.

- Multiple Sclerosis (MS): This is a chronic disease that affects the central nervous system, especially the brain and spinal cord. It can cause symptoms like numbness or weakness on one side of the body, coordination and balance problems, and bowel incontinence. Your mention of a lesion in your brain and white matter disease could be related to MS.
  - Treatment often involves medications to control symptoms and slow the progression of the disease, physical therapy, and in some cases, surgery.

- Migraine: Chronic headaches, especially if they are throbbing and located behind the eyes or temples, could be a sign of migraines. Migraines can sometimes be accompanied by other symptoms like dizziness and visual disturbances.
  - Treatment usually involves medications to relieve symptoms and prevent future attacks.

Please note that these are possibilities based on the information you''ve provided and should not be taken as a definitive diagnosis. It''s important to consult with a healthcare provider who can evaluate your symptoms and medical history in person.

Based on your symptoms, here are a few possible conditions:

- Heart Disease: Your symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in the hands could be signs of heart disease, especially given your history of high heart rate and heart ablation. Heart disease can cause a variety of symptoms, and it''s important to get evaluated by a healthcare professional if you''re experiencing these symptoms.
  - Diagnosis often involves a physical exam, blood tests, and imaging tests like an echocardiogram or stress test. Treatment can involve lifestyle changes, medications, and sometimes procedures or surgery.

- Anemia: This is a condition where your body doesn''t have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen to your tissues. This can cause fatigue, shortness of breath, and dizziness. Unintentional weight loss can also occur in some cases.
  - Diagnosis typically involves blood tests to check your red blood cell count and iron levels. Treatment often involves dietary changes or supplements to increase your iron intake, and in more severe cases, medications or blood transfusions may be needed.

- Thyroid Disease: Your thyroid is a small gland in your neck that produces hormones that regulate your metabolism. If it''s not working properly, it can cause a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, weight loss, and constipation. In some cases, it can also cause a high heart rate.
  - Diagnosis typically involves blood tests to check your thyroid hormone levels. Treatment depends on the specific type of thyroid disease, but it often involves medications to regulate your thyroid hormone levels.

Please note that this is not a comprehensive list of all possible conditions, and these are just possibilities based on the symptoms you''ve reported. It''s important to get evaluated by a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis.

### What you can do

Given the severity of your symptoms and the possibility of heart disease, it''s important to seek medical attention as soon as possible. Here are a few steps you can take:

1. Make an appointment with your healthcare provider as soon as possible to discuss your symptoms. If your symptoms worsen or you experience severe chest pain or difficulty breathing, seek emergency medical attention immediately.
2. Keep a symptom diary. Note when your symptoms occur, what you''re doing when they occur, and anything that makes them better or worse. This can help your healthcare provider diagnose your condition.
3. Continue taking your daily aspirin, as it can help prevent blood clots. However, don''t start taking any new medications or supplements without talking to your healthcare provider first.

No additional symptoms or relevant medical history were provided during the encounter.', '### What might be happening

Based on the information you''ve provided, you experienced a sudden, temporary change in your vision where everything appeared grey. This could potentially be due to:

- Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA): Sometimes referred to as a "mini-stroke," a TIA can cause temporary vision loss like you''ve described. It happens when part of the brain experiences a temporary lack of blood flow. This can cause stroke-like symptoms that resolve within 24 hours.
  - Diagnostic tests for TIA usually include a physical examination, blood tests, a CT or MRI scan, and possibly a carotid ultrasound to view the inside of your arteries.
  - Treatment usually involves medications to prevent a stroke, since having a TIA puts you at greater risk of having a full stroke.

- Low Blood Sugar: If you were feeling hungry around the time this happened, it''s possible that your blood sugar levels were low. This can cause a variety of symptoms, including blurry vision.
  - Treatment involves eating or drinking something to raise your blood sugar levels. If you experience low blood sugar frequently, you should see a doctor.

- Migraine: Some people may experience an aura (a temporary visual or sensory disturbance) before or during migraines. It usually lasts less than an hour.
  - Treatment typically involves medications to relieve the symptoms of migraines.

The only medication taken is NyQuil, started tonight, with no other medications, allergies, or known pre-existing conditions reported.', '### What might be happening

Based on the symptoms you''ve described, there are several possible conditions that could be causing your symptoms:

- Influenza (Flu): The flu is a common viral infection that can be deadly, especially in high-risk groups. The flu attacks the lungs, nose and throat. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, chest discomfort, cough, and fatigue.
  - Treatment usually involves rest and fluid to let the body fight off the infection. Your doctor may prescribe antiviral medication if you are in a high-risk group. 

- COVID-19: COVID-19 is a viral respiratory illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Symptoms can range from mild (or no symptoms) to severe illness. Some of the symptoms you''ve described, such as fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, are common symptoms of COVID-19.
  - Treatment involves supportive care to help relieve symptoms and for severe cases, hospitalization may be required.

- Pneumonia: Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing.
  - Treatment depends on the type and severity of the pneumonia. Bacterial pneumonia is treated with antibiotics.

### What you can do

You should seek immediate medical attention given the severity of your symptoms and the potential for these conditions to worsen quickly. It''s important to get a proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment. 

In the meantime, continue to rest, stay hydrated, and monitor your symptoms closely. If you have a fever, over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen can help reduce your fever and relieve any pain.

### What you should look out for

If you experience any of the following symptoms, you should seek emergency medical attention:

- Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
- Persistent pain or pressure in your chest
- New confusion or inability to arouse
- Bluish lips or face

She has no known allergies, no recent exposure to common allergens, but has been exposed to someone with similar symptoms. There is no past medical history of chronic illnesses or known drug allergies, and she is not taking any other medications.', '### What might be happening

Based on the symptoms you''ve described, the following conditions could be possible:

- Common Cold: This is a viral infection of your nose and throat (upper respiratory tract). It''s usually harmless, although it might not feel that way. Many types of viruses can cause a common cold. Symptoms of a cold may include a runny or stuffy nose, sneezing, cough, mild headache, and low-grade fever.
  - Treatment usually involves rest, hydration, and over-the-counter cold remedies to help manage symptoms.

- Acute Sinusitis: This is a short-term inflammation of the membranes that line your nose and surrounding sinuses. This impedes normal mucus drainage and causes you to feel stuffy. Symptoms can include a runny or stuffy nose, facial pain or pressure, and cough.
  - Treatment can involve use of decongestants, nasal sprays, and sometimes antibiotics if a bacterial infection is suspected.

- Influenza (Flu): This is a common viral infection that can be deadly, especially in high-risk groups. The flu attacks the lungs, nose and throat. Symptoms can be similar to a common cold, but are usually more severe and come on suddenly. Fever, aches and fatigue are more common with the flu.
  - Treatment usually involves rest, hydration, and over-the-counter flu remedies. Antiviral medications may be prescribed if the flu is caught early.

### What you can do

1. Continue taking your Robitussin as directed to help manage your cough.
2. Stay hydrated and get plenty of rest to help your body recover.
3. Use a humidifier to help moisten your nasal passages and throat, making you more comfortable.
4. If your symptoms persist or worsen, consult with a healthcare provider. They may want to perform a physical examination or order tests such as a throat swab to help determine the cause of your symptoms.

### What you should look out for

- If your symptoms persist for more than a week, or they get significantly worse, seek medical attention.
- If you develop a high fever, severe headache, chest pain or other worrying symptoms, seek medical attention immediately.

She has allergies to Zithromax, Tamiflu, and Reglan. No recent evaluations for autoimmune conditions have been conducted.', '### What might be happening

Based on the information you''ve provided, several conditions could be causing your symptoms:

- Fibromyalgia: This is a chronic condition characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and tenderness in localized areas. Your symptoms of profound fatigue, muscle weakness, and nerve pain could be related to fibromyalgia. However, fibromyalgia typically doesn''t cause localized swelling like you''re experiencing in your left thigh.
  - Treatment usually involves a combination of medication, exercise, stress management, and healthy lifestyle habits.

- Autonomic Dysfunction: Also known as dysautonomia, this condition occurs when your autonomic nervous system (which controls functions like heart rate, blood pressure, and bowel and bladder emptying) doesn''t work properly. This could explain your symptoms of shortness of breath, stress incontinence, and possibly your episodes of disorientation and profound fatigue.
  - Treatment typically involves managing symptoms and any underlying conditions.

- Side Effects of Medication: Some of your symptoms, such as mood swings and increased heart rate, could be side effects of your ADHD medication, Vyvanse. However, this wouldn''t explain all of your symptoms.

- Autoimmune Disease: Given your family history of lupus and Sjogren''s syndrome, it''s possible that an autoimmune disease could be causing some of your symptoms. Many autoimmune diseases can cause a wide range of symptoms, including fatigue, muscle weakness, and swelling.
  - Treatment typically involves managing symptoms and reducing immune system activity.

### What you can do

As an AI, I can''t diagnose you, but I recommend that you seek medical attention. Your symptoms are complex and require a thorough evaluation. Here are some steps you can take:

1. Schedule an appointment with your primary care doctor. They can perform a physical exam and order tests to help determine what''s causing your symptoms.
2. Keep a symptom diary. Note when each symptom occurs, how long it lasts, and any potential triggers. This can help your doctor identify patterns and potential causes.
3. If you''re concerned about side effects from your medication, don''t stop taking it without talking to your doctor first. They can help you weigh the benefits and risks, and they may be able to adjust your dosage or switch you to a different medication.

### What you should look out for

Seek immediate medical attention if you experience:

- Sudden, severe shortness of breath
- Chest pain
- Sudden, severe weakness, especially on one side of your body
- Sudden, severe headache
- Difficulty speaking or understanding speech
- Loss of balance or coordination
- Sudden vision changes

The patient reports a resting heart rate of 100 bpm that increases to 120 bpm upon standing, correlating with episodes of pain. Additionally, she experiences numbness in her pinky and ring fingers and forearm, but only when lying on her back, a symptom present for the past six years. She also reports constant vaginal bleeding four months postpartum. No jaundice, chest pain, shortness of breath, or changes in urine or stool color were reported. The patient has a medical history of depression and borderline personality disorder, with diagnoses made six years and two months ago, respectively. She is not currently on any medications and does not have any known drug allergies. Her mother had her gallbladder removed, suggesting a possible familial predisposition to gallbladder issues.', '### What might be happening

Based on your symptoms, the following conditions may be considered:

- Gallbladder Disease: The severe, sharp, stabbing pain in your upper right abdomen, along with the fact that your mother had her gallbladder removed, could suggest a gallbladder issue such as gallstones or cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder). These conditions can cause severe abdominal pain, often associated with meals. 
  - Treatment often involves dietary changes, pain management, and in some cases, surgery to remove the gallbladder.

- Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS): This condition is characterized by a rapid increase in heart rate upon standing. Symptoms can include lightheadedness, fainting, and rapid heartbeat, which you have described. 
  - Treatment typically involves lifestyle modifications like increasing fluid and salt intake, wearing compression stockings, and sometimes medication.

- Cubital Tunnel Syndrome: This condition is caused by increased pressure on the ulnar nerve, which can cause numbness and tingling in the ring and small finger, pain in the forearm, and/or weakness in the hand. Your description of numbness in your pinky and ring fingers and forearm when you lay on your back aligns with this condition.
  - Treatment can include avoiding pressure on the elbow, wearing a splint, or surgery in severe cases.

- Postpartum Hemorrhage: Constant vaginal bleeding four months postpartum is not typical and could be a sign of postpartum hemorrhage, which is excessive bleeding following childbirth.
  - Treatment can involve medication, a procedure to remove remaining placenta, or surgery in severe cases.

Please note that these are potential explanations based on your symptoms, but only a healthcare professional can provide a definitive diagnosis.

### What you can do

1. Seek immediate medical attention. The combination of your symptoms, particularly the severe abdominal pain and constant postpartum bleeding, is concerning and should be evaluated by a healthcare professional as soon as possible.
2. Try to avoid laying on your back to minimize the numbness in your fingers and forearm.
3. Keep a record of your symptoms and their severity to share with your healthcare provider.

### What you should look out for

Seek immediate medical attention if you experience:

- Intense, worsening abdominal pain
- Increased vaginal bleeding or passing large blood clots
- Fainting or loss of consciousness
- Chest pain or difficulty breathing

Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is:

- Migraines: These are severe, recurring headaches that can cause throbbing or pulsing pain, usually on one side of the head. Migraines can last for hours to days and can be accompanied by sensitivity to light and sound, nausea, and vomiting. They can be triggered by various factors, including hormonal changes (such as those that occur with your menstrual cycle), stress, certain foods or drinks, lack of sleep, and dehydration. 
  - Treatment for migraines often involves a combination of medications to relieve symptoms and prevent future attacks, as well as lifestyle changes to avoid triggers.

However, other possibilities include:

- Tension Headaches: These are the most common type of headache and can cause a constant ache or pressure around the head, especially at the temples or back of the head and neck. They can be caused by stress, lack of sleep, poor posture, or eye strain. 
  - Treatment typically involves over-the-counter pain relievers, stress management techniques, and lifestyle changes.

- Cluster Headaches: These are severe headaches that occur in clusters or cycles. They are characterized by sudden, debilitating pain on one side of the head, often around the eye.

Please note that while these are the most likely diagnoses based on your symptoms, only a healthcare professional can provide a definitive diagnosis.

### What you can do

Here are some steps you can take to manage your symptoms:

1. Over-the-counter pain relievers: Non-prescription medications such as ibuprofen, aspirin, or acetaminophen can help relieve the pain of a headache. However, they should be used sparingly, as overuse can lead to rebound headaches.

2. Hydration: Make sure you''re drinking enough water throughout the day, as dehydration can trigger headaches.

3. Regular sleep: Try to maintain a regular sleep schedule, as lack of sleep can also trigger headaches.

4. Stress management: Techniques such as yoga, meditation, and deep breathing can help reduce stress, which can trigger headaches.

5. Avoid triggers: If you notice that certain foods, drinks, or situations trigger your headaches, try to avoid them.

6. Cold compress: Applying a cold compress to your forehead or the back of your neck can help reduce the pain of a headache.

Remember to consult a healthcare professional for a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan.

### What you should look out for

- Influenza (Flu): This is a common viral infection that can be deadly, especially in high-risk groups. The flu attacks the lungs, nose, and throat. Symptoms include fever, chills, muscle aches, cough, congestion, runny nose, headaches, and fatigue.
  - Treatment: Antiviral drugs can lessen symptoms and shorten the time you are sick by 1 or 2 days. They also can prevent serious flu complications, like pneumonia.

- Strep Throat: This is a bacterial infection that can make your throat feel sore and scratchy. Strep throat accounts for only a small portion of sore throats.
  - Treatment: If you have strep throat — which is caused by bacteria — your doctor will prescribe antibiotics to kill the infection.

- Mononucleosis: This is often called mono or kissing disease. This virus is transmitted through saliva, so you can get it through kissing, but you can also be exposed through a cough or sneeze, or by sharing a glass or food utensils with someone who has mono.
  - Treatment: There''s no specific therapy available to treat infectious mononucleosis. Antibiotics don''t work against viral infections such as mono. Treatment mainly involves taking care of yourself, such as getting enough rest, eating a healthy diet and drinking plenty of fluids.

There is no past medical history of chronic illnesses or conditions.', '### What might be happening

Based on the information you''ve provided, the most likely cause of your knee pain is:

- Patellar Tendonitis (Jumper''s Knee): This is an injury to the tendon connecting your kneecap (patella) to your shinbone. The patellar tendon plays a pivotal role in the way you use your leg muscles. In particular, it helps your muscles extend the lower leg so that you can kick a ball, push the pedals on your bicycle, and jump up in the air. Jumper’s knee predominantly occurs in athletes participating in jumping sports such as basketball or volleyball. However, even people who don’t participate in jumping or running sports can get jumper’s knee.
  - Treatment typically involves rest, ice, and over-the-counter pain relievers. Physical therapy exercises can also help strengthen the muscles around your knee and improve your balance.

Please note that this is a likely possibility based on the information you''ve provided, but other conditions could also cause similar symptoms. It''s important to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis.

### What you can do

1. Rest your knee: Avoid putting too much weight on your knee. If you need to move around, try to avoid jumping or running.
2. Ice your knee: Apply a cold pack to your knee for 15 minutes at a time, several times a day.
3. Over-the-counter pain relievers: Nonprescription medicines such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve) can help reduce pain and inflammation.
4. Strengthen your muscles: Once the pain subsides, exercises to strengthen your quadriceps can help improve muscle balance and decrease the risk of future injuries.

### What you should look out for

If your pain continues for more than a few days, or if it''s accompanied by significant swelling or redness, you should seek medical attention. Also, if you start to experience instability in your knee, difficulty walking, or severe pain, these could be signs of a more serious injury and you should seek medical attention immediately.

  - Treatment often involves wrist splinting, avoiding activities that worsen symptoms, and pain relievers. Severe cases may require surgery.

- Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS): This is a form of chronic pain that usually affects an arm or a leg and typically develops after an injury. The pain is out of proportion to the severity of the initial injury.
  - Treatment typically involves a combination of physical therapy and medications.

- Peripheral Neuropathy: This results from damage to your peripheral nerves, which often causes weakness, numbness and pain, usually in your hands and feet. It can also affect other areas of your body.
  - Treatment typically involves managing the symptoms and preventing further damage.

### What you can do

1. Rest your hand and wrist as much as possible. Avoid activities that cause pain, swelling or discomfort.
2. Apply ice to your wrist for 15 minutes each hour. Do this for the first 24 to 48 hours.
3. Use over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen to help reduce pain and inflammation.
4. Wear a wrist splint at night to keep your wrist in a neutral position. This can help to reduce pressure on your median nerve.

### What you should look out for

- If your symptoms persist or worsen despite conservative management, you should seek medical attention.
- If you develop severe pain, significant swelling, or changes in skin color, you should seek immediate medical attention.
- If you notice progressive weakness or loss of function in your hand or arm, you should seek immediate medical attention.

No fever, back pain, or blood in urine has been reported, but she has experienced recent nausea, the connection of which to the urinary symptoms is uncertain.', '### What might be happening

Based on the information you''ve provided, the most likely diagnoses include:

- Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): This is an infection in any part of your urinary system — your kidneys, bladder, ureters, and urethra. Most UTIs are caused by bacteria, but some are caused by viruses and fungi. UTIs are more common in women than men. They can occur at any age but are more common in sexually active women and women who have gone through menopause. Symptoms can include a persistent urge to urinate, burning sensation during urination, and lower abdominal pain.
  - Treatment typically involves antibiotics prescribed by a healthcare provider.

- Interstitial Cystitis (IC): Also known as painful bladder syndrome, IC is a chronic condition causing bladder pressure, bladder pain and sometimes pelvic pain, ranging from mild discomfort to severe pain. The pain may be felt in the urethra, lower abdomen, lower back, or the pelvic or perineal area.
  - Treatment for IC varies from person to person and often includes changes in diet, medication, and physical therapy.

- Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs): Some STIs, like chlamydia and gonorrhea, can cause pain during urination. Given that you''ve been sexually active and not using protection, this could be a possibility.
  - Treatment typically involves antibiotics prescribed by a healthcare provider.

### What you can do

1. Make an appointment with a healthcare provider: Given the duration and severity of your symptoms, it''s important to get a formal diagnosis. Your healthcare provider can order tests, such as a urine test or a pelvic exam, to determine the cause of your symptoms.

2. Stay hydrated: Drinking plenty of water can help dilute your urine and ensure that you urinate more frequently, flushing bacteria out of your urinary tract.

3. Avoid irritants: Certain products, such as deodorant sprays, powders, and douches in the genital area can irritate the urethra.

4. Urinate before and after sexual activity: This can help flush bacteria away from your urinary tract, preventing infections.

### What you should look out for

- If your symptoms worsen or don''t improve, seek medical attention immediately.
- If you develop a fever, back pain, or vomiting, these could be signs of a more serious condition, like a kidney infection, and you should seek medical attention immediately.

Based on the symptoms you''ve described, several possibilities could be considered:

- **Thyroid Disease**: Given your history of thyroid disease and thyroid cancer, some of your symptoms such as fatigue, dizziness, and changes in appetite could be related to an imbalance in your thyroid hormones. Thyroid disease can also cause changes in skin (like a rash) and mood disturbances.

- **Anemia**: This condition, which involves a lack of healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to your body''s tissues, could explain your fatigue, dizziness, and paleness. It can be caused by many conditions, including endometriosis, which you have a history of.

- **Autoimmune Disease**: Given your history of thyroid disease and endometriosis, both of which have autoimmune components, it''s possible that another autoimmune condition could be causing some of your symptoms. Autoimmune diseases can cause a wide range of symptoms including fatigue, rashes, and joint pain.

- **Depression or Anxiety**: Both of these conditions, which you have a history of, can cause physical symptoms such as fatigue, difficulty sleeping, and changes in appetite. They can also worsen the perception of other symptoms.

- **Side effects of medication**: If you''re taking any medication for your pre-existing conditions, some of your symptoms could be side effects. 

### What you can do

Given the range and severity of your symptoms, it''s important to seek medical attention. Here are some steps you can take:

1. Schedule an appointment with your primary care provider to discuss your symptoms. They can perform a physical examination and order appropriate tests, such as blood tests to check your thyroid function and red blood cell count.

2. Keep a symptom diary. Note when each of your symptoms occur, their severity, and any potential triggers. This can help your healthcare provider in diagnosing your condition.

3. Try to maintain a balanced diet and stay hydrated, especially since you''ve been experiencing a loss of appetite.

4. Try to establish a regular sleep schedule, which can help manage your insomnia and fatigue. Avoid caffeine and electronic screens for at least an hour before bed.

5. If you''re feeling anxious or depressed, reach out to a mental health professional. They can provide strategies to help manage your symptoms.

When productive, the cough yields yellow mucus, which decreases over time. The patient feels chest tightness upon deep inhalation but does not experience wheezing or shortness of breath. Body aches accompany the cough due to its severity. The patient was diagnosed with bronchitis in 2014 and has been prescribed Albuterol and Benzonatate, which provide only minor relief. The patient takes these medications as needed, along with occasional Ibuprofen, and has no known allergies or adverse reactions to medications. The patient has never smoked and has a family history of asthma, with his father experiencing a similar cough when ill. There is no known pre-existing or chronic illness, but the patient suspects chronic bronchitis due to the recurring nature of the cough.', '### What might be happening

Based on the information you have provided, possible explanations for your symptoms include:

- Chronic Bronchitis: This condition is characterized by a long-term inflammation of the bronchi, the large airways in the lungs. It is commonly associated with a productive cough that lasts for at least three months, with recurring bouts occurring for at least two consecutive years. Given your history of bronchitis and the recurring nature of your cough, this could be a possibility.
  - Treatment typically involves medications to open the airways (like albuterol), reduce inflammation, and manage symptoms. In some cases, pulmonary rehabilitation or oxygen therapy may be recommended.

- Asthma: This is a condition in which your airways narrow and swell and produce extra mucus. This can make breathing difficult and trigger coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. Given your family history of asthma, this could be a possibility.
  - Treatment typically involves the use of medications to control symptoms and prevent asthma attacks.

- Post-Infectious Cough: This is a cough that remains after a common cold or an upper respiratory tract infection. It can last for several weeks.
  - Treatment typically involves managing the symptoms and may include cough suppressants, inhaled steroids, or antibiotics if a bacterial infection is suspected.

### What you can do

It would be best to consult a doctor about your symptoms so that they can provide a formal assessment and order relevant tests if necessary. In the meantime, you can try the following to manage your symptoms:

1. Avoid triggers that can make your cough worse, such as cold air or exercise.
2. Stay hydrated and use a humidifier to help soothe your throat and loosen mucus.
3. Over-the-counter cough suppressants may provide some relief.

### What you should look out for

Reasons to see a doctor more urgently:

- If your cough is accompanied by chest pain or shortness of breath.
- If you cough up blood or have a high fever.
- If your symptoms worsen or do not improve after a few weeks.
